# Gurarpit Singh — Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio, showcasing my work in backend engineering, ML systems, and data-driven decision support.

Live Website: https://gurarpits.vercel.app  
Focus: Backend Engineering · ML & Data Systems · Research-to-Production Pipelines

## About the Portfolio

This portfolio represents my approach to building systems that turn complex data into actionable signals.  
Rather than focusing purely on UI, the site highlights:

Backend architecture and APIs  
Semantic and ML-based systems  
Research-oriented engineering projects  
Decision-support tools in healthcare, accessibility, and research intelligence  

“Good decisions start with good data.”

## What I Work On

### Backend and Systems
Building RESTful APIs and backend services  
WebSockets and async systems  
Data pipelines and service boundaries  
Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL  

### ML, Data and NLP
Semantic search and embeddings  
Verification and signal aggregation  
Knowledge-driven workflows  
Vector databases and retrieval systems  

### Research-to-Production
Translating research ideas into usable systems  
Accessibility-focused interfaces  
Evidence-driven ML tooling

## Featured Projects

Some highlighted projects from the portfolio:

VibroBraille  
Braille-first AI reading interface that converts semantic meaning into tactile smartphone signals for accessibility.

SRME (Semantic Research Matchmaking Engine)  
A semantic indexing and matching system built on 500+ faculty research publications.

ARES (Proof of Concept)  
Research integrity and verification engine using evidence aggregation metrics.

BeCured Support  
Healthcare diagnostic decision-support system designed to frame ML outputs as interpretable medical signals.

Each project focuses on systems thinking, not just model accuracy or UI polish.
