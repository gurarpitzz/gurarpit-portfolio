# Gurarpit Singh — Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio.  
It showcases my work in backend engineering, ML systems, and data-driven decision support, with a strong emphasis on building systems that actually get used.

## About the Portfolio

This portfolio reflects how I think about engineering problems.

I am less interested in surface-level features and more focused on how data flows through a system, how signals are extracted, and how technical output can be turned into decisions people can trust.

The site highlights work around backend architecture, semantic and ML-based systems, and research-oriented engineering projects, especially in domains like healthcare, accessibility, and research intelligence.

Good decisions start with good data.

## What I Work On

### Backend and Systems

I build backend services that are structured, readable, and designed with scale in mind.  
My work typically involves API design, async workflows, and clearly defined service boundaries.

Core areas include RESTful APIs, WebSockets, backend system design, and data pipelines using Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.

### ML, Data and NLP

My ML work focuses less on chasing accuracy numbers and more on building usable systems.  
This includes semantic search, embeddings, verification logic, and retrieval-based workflows that surface meaningful signals rather than raw predictions.

### Research to Production

A recurring theme in my projects is translating research ideas into systems that can exist outside a paper.  
This includes accessibility-first interfaces, evidence-driven ML tooling, and production-ready research prototypes.

## Featured Projects

The portfolio highlights a selection of projects that reflect this approach.

VibroBraille  
A braille-first AI reading interface that converts semantic meaning into tactile smartphone signals, designed to improve accessibility rather than just automate text.

SRME (Semantic Research Matchmaking Engine)  
A semantic indexing and matching system built on more than 500 faculty research publications, focused on intelligent discovery rather than keyword search.

ARES (Proof of Concept)  
A research integrity and verification engine that aggregates evidence signals to reason about credibility and consistency.

BeCured Support  
A healthcare diagnostic decision-support system designed to present ML outputs as interpretable medical signals instead of opaque predictions.

Across all projects, the emphasis is on systems thinking, not just UI polish or model metrics.
