ARES (Automated Research Evidence Scorer) is a proof-of-concept for a new generation of integrity tools. It moves beyond simple plagiarism detection into the realm of **logical and empirical verification**.

## The Formula
At the heart of ARES is a verification function: `V(C) = f(R, S, N, W)`, where:
- **R**: Replicability score
- **S**: Source credibility
- **N**: Network consensus
- **W**: Weighting factor

## System Logic
The system aggregates evidence from multiple scientific databases, weights them based on peer-review impact, and calculates a cumulative "Confidence Score" for specific claims.

## Future of Verification
ARES demonstrates how algorithmic auditing can be applied to the sprawling ecosystem of digital research, providing a first line of defense against misinformation and hallucinated data in automated systems.
