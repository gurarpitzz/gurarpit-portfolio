AETHER (Autonomous, Evolving, Tamper-proof Honeypot Ecosystem with Reactive Intelligence) represents a paradigm shift in cybersecurity. Instead of waiting for a breach, AETHER actively engages attackers, leading them into a synthesized illusionary environment.

## The Evolutionary Deception Model
AETHER moves beyond static decoys. It uses an **Evolutionary Deception** model where the system analyzes tactical intent and generates context-aware responses in real time.

## Digital DNA
Each interaction with the system is parsed into a multi-dimensional feature set known as **Digital DNA**. This captures the attacker's "genetic" profile, allowing the defense to anticipate and mitigate future mutations of the attack vector.

## Mathematical Precision
The engine is driven by a state-space transition system, calculating an **Adversary Confusion Index (ACI)** to dynamically adjust the complexity of the deception surface.

## Active Defense Layers
- **SSH Layer**: Synthesizes varying banner versions and implements artificial latency.
- **HTTP Layer**: Generates dynamic web traps and contextually relevant "leaked info."
- **SQL Layer**: Implements Honeytokens that return functionally fake error messages.
