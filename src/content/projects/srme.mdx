SRME (Semantic Research Matchmaking Engine) was built to solve the "discovery gap" in academic institutions. By mapping the semantic distance between research papers and faculty expertise, it provides a data-driven way to find collaborators and mentors.

## Data Pipeline
The engine orchestrates a complex pipeline that scrapes metadata from 500+ faculty profiles, extracts semantic meaning using state-of-the-art NLP models (BERT/Sentence-Transformers), and stores them in a vector database for millisecond-latency retrieval.

## Semantic Intelligence
Traditional keyword search fails to capture the nuances of interdisciplinary research. SRME uses **Vector Similarity (Cosine)** to identify hidden connections between researchers who might use different terminology for similar concepts.

## Visualization
Research connections are surfaced through an interactive knowledge graph, allowing users to visually navigate the "expertise clusters" within their organization.
