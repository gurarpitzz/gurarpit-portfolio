BeCured is designed as an assistant, not a replacement, for medical professionals. It focuses on the early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy, where timing is critical for vision preservation.

## Responsible AI
Unlike "black box" diagnostic tools, BeCured incorporates interpretability layers (Grad-CAM) that highlight the specific regions of a retinal scan that triggered a high-risk classification. This allows doctors to verify the AI's reasoning.

## Performance
The underlying Deep Learning models are trained on large-scale medical imaging datasets, achieving high sensitivity to early-stage microaneurysms that are often difficult to detect manually.

## Deployment
The tool is packaged as a high-performance API using FastAPI, ensuring it can be integrated into existing hospital management systems with minimal friction.
